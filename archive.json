If that is the intent, changing from \"application\" to \"deployment\" may not help (these are different concepts). \r\n\r\nPerhaps just an introductory sentence for that paragraph - something like: \"An application may access multiple OAuth protected resources in order to complete an operation. Each OAuth protected resource may have their own resource metadata. In this case, the application may define and register different well-known URI path suffixes used to publish protected resource metadata as used by those applications to enable a client to obtain the resource metadata for each of the underlying resources.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I think my confusion here was more about the lack of clarity on the relationship of the application (which may itself be an OAuth protected resource?) and the OAuth protected resources (which it relies on to perform an action). \r\n\r\n",

For example, the authorization server might silently ignore the `resource` parameter of the authorization request.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the authorization server should probably include the `resource` back in the authorization response similar to how this is done for the `scope` parameter (and in a sense for the [`authorization_details` parameter](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-rar-21.html#name-token-response)). Such an option should probably have been included in [RFC8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707), however.\r\n\r\nAlternatively (or in addition) some authorization server metadata could be used to indicate that it supports resource indication.",

      "body": "The current draft [specifies that](https://drafts.oauth.net/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata.html#name-protected-resource-metadata-v):\r\n\r\n> If the protected resource metadata was retrieved from a URL returned by the protected resource via the WWW-Authenticate resource_metadata parameter, then the resource value returned MUST be identical to the URL that the client used to make the request to the resource server. If these values are not identical, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.\r\n\r\nIf I am reading this currently, if the client makes a request to `https://resource.example.com/api/foo`, then the metadata must contain `\"resource\": \"https://resource.example.com/api/foo\"` but not something like `\"resource\": \"https://resource.example.com/api/\"` (and therefore the resource_metadata must be `https://resource.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/foo`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the [metadata example](https://drafts.oauth.net/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata.html#name-protected-resource-metadata-r) uses:\r\n\r\n~~~json\r\n\"resource\": \"https://resource.example.com\",\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis suggests that the draft would encourage using a root API resource identifier (instead of a resource identifier for each path). \r\n\r\nShould the authorization server return a different metadata document URI path?\r\n\r\nOr should the authorization server return metadata document for a base (API) path? In this case, the requirement should probably be modified to something like:\r\n\r\n> If the protected resource metadata was retrieved from a URL returned by the protected resource via the WWW-Authenticate resource_metadata parameter, then **the URL that the client used to make the request to the resource server must be in scope of the the resource value returned**. Otherwise, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.\r\n\r\nMoreover, should the client check that the `resource_metadata` URI is the same URI as the one found by applying the `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` transformation to the \"resource\" metadata value? (i.e. should the client check that `resource_metadata_uri == origin + \"/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\" + request_path`?)\r\n",

So assuming they are parsing and validating authorization server metadata correctly, they should be able to do the same for resource metadata. So, I think with that, I am good with approving the changes.",
